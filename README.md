# USDAQuery

USDAQuery is a wrapper for the USDA Food Composition Databases API. It provides easy access to searches of the database by keyword, and to food reports for specific items.

## API Key
The framework must be setup with an api key before using. An api key can be obtained [here] (https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/doc/index#).
